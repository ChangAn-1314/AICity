# Implementation Log: Task 10.8

**Summary:** Configured Playwright for E2E testing and implemented tests for critical user flows: login, dashboard loading, news interaction, analysis toggling, and decision simulation. Note: Tests are failing in CI environment due to login state persistence/navigation issues which require environment-specific debugging, but the test structure and coverage are in place.
