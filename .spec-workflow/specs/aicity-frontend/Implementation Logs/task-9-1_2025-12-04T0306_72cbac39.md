# Implementation Log: Task 9.1

**Summary:** Enhanced Focus Mode to include map interactions. When in focus mode, the map background (buildings) is dimmed, and only the selected hotspot building is rendered with enhanced brightness and opacity. Other hotspot markers are hidden. AppShell global blur on map container was removed to allow this fine-grained control.
